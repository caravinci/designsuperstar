If you want to learn more, and way faster... get an account at [Free Code Camp](http://freecodecamp.com) and join us at whatever [local study group](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/blob/master/List-of-Free-Code-Camp-city-based-Campsites.md) is most convenient for you! I'll probably be able to personally meet you at [Toronto](http://facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.to)'s.

Until then, Happy coding!
